## Introduction

The HTML code in this repository functions as a mock portfolio for myself. As of now, there is only one project listed, with 5 more example projects listed along with it. 

## Installation

N/A

## Description

This challenge was meant to have us use things like flexbox and the other css tools we have learned to create an interactive website that is clean and responsive. This site
uses interactive buttons to send users to each project, as well as give a basic introduction to myself with some contact info.

## Usage

See commented lines in the HTML and CSS files to see exactly what is going on under the hood. Hover over any image or button to see a description of the project, and click to go to the deployed site. Website is hosted [here.](https://nephh.github.io/portfolio-template)
